# Mesh Generation in Godot following Freya Holmer's Lecture

![](https://github.com/fhgaha/water_slides_godot/blob/main/demonstration.gif)

This Godot 4.3 project implementing the generation process for a road-like mesh. In this case the shape is a tube though. 

If you watched the video, this is slides version which should be more optimized. But GDScript was used, so it should be less optimized.

Thing is you have only two points to control. You can rotate both however and move both on all the axis. And play with z scale of the both points, it does something too.
